/**
 * A {@link TimeBasedWriterPartitioner} for Timestamped byte[] records whose payload contains json.
 * This class is a superclass of {@link TimestampedRecordTimeBasedWriterPartitioner} overriding the
 * {@getNonKafkaTimestamp} method only.
 *
 * This class uses {@link JsonStringTimestampExtractor} to parse the Json and extract the timestamp.
 * It takes advantage of {@link JsonStringTimeBasedWriterPartitioner} configuration keys for timestamp
 * column and timestamp format, as well as static classes to extract their values.
 *
 * Note: If a record doesn't contain the specified field, or if no field is specified,
 *       the current timestamp will be used.
